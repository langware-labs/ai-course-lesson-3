# Game design

`html-builder` owns the folder, the look and the share button. This skill owns
what makes it a **game**: it must be playable in the first version, fun in the
first ten seconds, and smooth on a cheap phone.

## Build order — playable first

1. **The core action, ugly is fine for five minutes:** the thing the player does
   over and over (move and shoot, drop and rotate, plant and harvest). Get it
   working and feeling right before anything else.
2. **A goal and a fail state:** score, a timer, lives, a win condition.
3. **The screens:** start → playing → paused → game over (see below).
4. **Look and juice:** palette and characters from `frontend-design`, then
   feedback for every action.
5. **Difficulty curve and the high score.**

Each step ends playable. Never show the student a version that doesn't start.

## Files

`games/<name>/index.html`, `style.css`, `game.js` (split into more classic
`<script defer>` files — `input.js`, `levels.js`, loaded in order — once `game.js`
passes ~400 lines; no ES modules, see `html-builder`), `share.js`. No
libraries: Canvas 2D and the DOM cover every game here, and nothing has to be
downloaded.

## The loop

Real-time games run on `requestAnimationFrame` with a **fixed-step update**, so
the game runs at the same speed on a 60 Hz phone and a 144 Hz monitor:

```js
const STEP = 1000 / 60;
let last = performance.now(), acc = 0;
function frame(now) {
  acc += Math.min(now - last, 250); // a hidden tab must not fast-forward the world
  last = now;
  while (acc >= STEP) { update(STEP / 1000); acc -= STEP; }
  render();
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
requestAnimationFrame(frame);
```

- Speeds are per second (`x += speed * dt`), never per frame.
- **Pause on `visibilitychange`** (tab hidden, phone locked) and show the pause screen.
- Expose `window.advanceTime = (ms) => { …run update() ms/STEP times; render(); }`
  so a test can step the game deterministically, and keep the whole game state in
  one `state` object.
- Turn-based games (board games, a farm with slow ticks) don't need a loop: update
  on each move or on `setInterval`, and redraw.

## Canvas that fits and stays sharp

```js
function fit() {
  const dpr = Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio || 1, 2);
  const { width, height } = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  canvas.width = Math.round(width * dpr);
  canvas.height = Math.round(height * dpr);
  ctx.setTransform(dpr * width / WORLD_W, 0, 0, dpr * height / WORLD_H, 0, 0);
}
addEventListener('resize', fit);
```

Draw in a fixed **world size** (e.g. 360×640 for a portrait phone game, 960×540 for
a computer game) and let CSS size the canvas to the screen with `aspect-ratio`,
letterboxing the rest. Collision and movement then never depend on the screen.

## Controls

Read input into one `input` object (`input.left`, `input.fire`, `input.aim`) and
let `update()` read only that — the keyboard, touch buttons and a joystick all
write to the same object.

**Phone (portrait):**
- On-screen controls in the bottom third, where thumbs are: at least 64px, with a
  pressed state. A **virtual joystick** for movement (bottom-left), action buttons
  bottom-right. Use Pointer Events (`pointerdown/move/up` with `setPointerCapture`)
  so several fingers work at once.
- Swipe and tap where they fit better (Tetris, a board game, a farm).
- `touch-action: none` on the play area, and call `preventDefault()` in the
  handlers, so the page doesn't scroll or zoom while playing.
- A short vibration on a hit (`navigator.vibrate?.(30)`), optional.

**Computer:**
- Arrows and WASD for movement, Space for the main action, Esc / P for pause, M
  for mute. Show the keys on the start screen.
- `event.code` (physical key), not `event.key`, so a Hebrew keyboard layout works.
- First-person aiming uses Pointer Lock (`canvas.requestPointerLock()` on click).

## The screens every game needs

- **Start:** the game's name big, one line on how to play, the controls, a big
  "Play" button, and the best score so far.
- **Playing:** a HUD with score / lives / level, kept clear of the share pill's
  corner; a pause button on phones.
- **Paused:** resume, restart, mute.
- **Game over / win:** the score, "New record!" when it is one, and a big "Play
  again". This is where the player is proudest — make it look like a reward.

## Juice — make every action feel good

Small feedback is the difference between "it works" and "it's fun":

- Hits: a short flash, a burst of particles (stars, bolts, sparks), a tiny screen
  shake (3–6px for 150ms), a pop sound.
- Score: the number bumps up in size, a floating "+10" rises from where it happened.
- Movement: ease in and out instead of snapping; a little squash on landing.
- Sounds made with the Web Audio API (an oscillator with a quick envelope) need no
  sound files; start the `AudioContext` on the first tap, and offer mute.
- Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`: no shake, fewer particles.

## Difficulty

- The first 20 seconds are easy — the player learns by playing, not by reading.
- Then ramp smoothly: speed or enemy count grows a little every level or every N
  points; a breather after each jump.
- Save the best score in `localStorage` (`<game-name>.best`), and show it on the
  start and game-over screens — "beat my record" is what friends get the link for.

## Performance on a cheap phone

- Reuse objects (pools for bullets and particles) instead of creating new ones every
  frame; cap particles (~200).
- Draw static backgrounds once to an offscreen canvas and copy it each frame.
- No `shadowBlur` in the loop; no DOM reads/writes inside the loop except the HUD,
  and update the HUD only when its value changes.

## Recipes

Content rules always apply: action targets robots, aliens, monsters or objects —
never people — with no blood and no real weapons (see the agent's content rules).

### First-person shooter
- **3D without libraries: a raycaster** (the Wolfenstein technique) on Canvas 2D.
  A grid map (`1` = wall), the player has `x, y, angle`; for each screen column
  cast a ray with DDA, draw a vertical wall slice whose height is
  `screenH / distance` (correct fisheye by multiplying by `cos(rayAngle - angle)`),
  shade by distance and side. Enemies are billboard sprites sorted far-to-near,
  hidden behind walls using a per-column depth buffer.
- Theme: a laser-tag arena against robots, a space station with aliens, a paintball
  maze, a snowball fight against snowmen.
- Computer: WASD to move, mouse (Pointer Lock) to look, click to fire.
  Phone (portrait): the 3D view in the top ~60%, a joystick bottom-left to move,
  drag on the right half to turn, a big fire button bottom-right.
- Aim with a crosshair at the centre; a hit is the sprite under the centre column
  within range. Ammo or a cooldown, health pickups, a wave counter.

### Fight simulator
- Side view, two fighters (robots, mechs, cartoon animals, sumo pushers), each with
  health, a state machine (`idle → walk → attack → hit → block → ko`), and attacks
  with a wind-up, an active window and a recovery — that timing is what makes it
  feel like fighting.
- Hitboxes are rectangles active only during an attack's active frames; a hit
  knocks back, flashes the defender and gives a short "hit-stop" freeze (60–100ms).
- Health bars at the top, a round timer, best of three rounds, a "special" meter
  that fills as you land hits.
- Modes: vs the computer (a simple AI that approaches, attacks in range at random
  intervals, blocks sometimes, gets sharper each round) and two players on the same
  keyboard (WASD+F/G vs arrows+K/L). On a phone: vs computer only, joystick + attack
  / block / special buttons.
- A KO is a robot falling apart into bolts or a fighter pushed out of the ring —
  never a hurt person.

### Farm sim
- A tile grid (CSS grid or canvas); each tile has a state
  (`empty → plowed → seeded → growing → ready`) and a timestamp. Crops grow by
  elapsed time, so growth continues while the game is closed: compute it from
  `Date.now()` on load.
- Loop of play: plant → water → wait → harvest → sell → buy better seeds, animals,
  more land, decorations. Coins and a small shop. Short grow times (20s–2min) so it
  stays lively in class.
- Save the whole farm in `localStorage` on every change, and load it on start — the
  farm is still there tomorrow.
- Phone: tap a tile to act, a tool bar at the bottom. Computer: click, number keys
  for tools.

### Board game
- DOM + CSS grid, not canvas: a board of `<button>` cells is accessible and easy to
  animate. Ideas: Connect Four, checkers, Reversi, snakes and ladders, memory cards,
  tic-tac-toe on a big board.
- Keep the rules as pure functions over a `state` (`legalMoves(state)`,
  `applyMove(state, move)`, `winner(state)`) — that's what makes the computer
  opponent easy.
- Two players on the same device (pass the phone), and vs the computer: easy =
  random legal move, medium = win if you can / block if you must, hard = minimax a
  few moves deep.
- Show whose turn it is clearly, animate pieces moving, highlight legal moves and
  the winning line. Dice are fine; no betting.

### Tetris
- A 10×20 grid, the seven pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) in their usual colours, a
  "7-bag" randomizer (shuffle all seven, deal them out, repeat) so droughts don't
  happen.
- Rotation with simple wall kicks (try the move, then one cell left, right, up);
  a ghost piece showing where it lands; hard drop; a next-piece preview; hold.
- Gravity speeds up every 10 lines (level); score 100/300/500/800 × level for
  1/2/3/4 lines; a short flash on cleared rows.
- A little "lock delay" (~500ms) after a piece touches down, so the player can
  slide it — this alone makes it feel professional.
- Computer: ← → move, ↑ rotate, ↓ soft drop, Space hard drop, C hold.
  Phone: tap = rotate, swipe left/right = move, swipe down = hard drop, plus
  on-screen buttons for players who prefer them.

## Before showing it

Play it yourself through `window.advanceTime` and a few simulated inputs, then run
`web-tester` at the right screen size. Check: it starts, the controls do what they
say, the score counts, game over shows and "Play again" really restarts, the high
score survives a reload, nothing is covered by the share pill.
